Logging
-------

This project provides a general-purpose logger utility in `src/utils/logger.py`.

**Usage Example:**

```python
from src.utils.logger import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.error("This is an error message.")
```

You can attach this logger to any module or script in the project.

## Goals
- Reduce time to establish a repo specifically for DS needs.
- To align data scientists in terms of skills and tools used.
- Make project standard, easier to observe and predictable.

## Description:

### Project structure

The current architecture is based on [Cookiecutter DS](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) approach. The reasoning behind it you can find [here](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).

### Code versioning tools
To track, keep and share your codings [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) services are required.

### Default programming language
To leverage modern programming stack it is recommended to start with [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130/) as default.

### Dependency management
To follow Single-Source-Of-Truth concept it makes sense to use [pyproject.toml](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/) to store project configuration. `pyproject.toml` configuration file allows to use the same configuration on different project steps: CI/CD, dev, test, prod etc.

#### uv
Newly announced [uv tool](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

To create new virtual environment:
```bash
uv venv -p 3.13
```

You might need to install or provide path to python 3.13 first.

Activate an environment on macOS and Linux:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:
```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

To install dependencies from `pyproject.toml` (and `uv.lock`):
```bash
uv pip sync --extra dev --extra lint --extra test
```

### Codestyle: ruff
Both for code linting and formatting Ruff package is proposed to use. See [here](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for more details.

Commands:
```bash
ruff format .
ruff check .

ruff check . --fix
```

### CI/CD: GitHub Actions

As a baseline, CI with integrated code style is provided (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). The current setup is based on using public Actions and configuring CI with `pyproject.toml` file. It is also possible to use custom Actions.

### Test suite: pytest

This project uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for running tests and [pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for measuring test coverage.

To run the tests and generate a coverage report, use the following commands:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest -v .
coverage report -m
```

The CI is configured to fail if the test coverage is below 80%.


## Getting started
1. Create repo from the template

While creating repo, choose the current one as a template. Check [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) for more details.

It is also possible to use this repository as a template in GitHub interface.

2. Install, compile and activate virtual environment
See [uv](#uv)

3. Change parameters `pyproject.toml` if needed.
4. Tweak CI configuration `.github/workflows/ci.yml` if needed.
5. Put you source code in `src` folder.
6. Enjoy coding :)

## Best practices

### Makefile
Codestyle functionality could be applied locally using the Makefile created and the following command:

```bash
make precommit
```

or using `.sh` file directly:

```bash
bash ./precommit.sh
```
